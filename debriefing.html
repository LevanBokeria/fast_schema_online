          '<p><br>On some of these boards, you had stable visible pictures which would show up at the beginning and ends of each trial. We hypothesize that people can use these 6 visible pictures as "landmarks" or "anchors" in learning the locations of the hidden pictures. On other boards, sometimes these 6 visible pictures swapped locations with each other, sometimes only 2/6 remained stable while others moved randomly, sometimes all 6 of them moved randomly, and on one of the boards you didnt have any visible pictures at all, only the hidden ones. This way, we want to see whether your learning of locations of the hidden pictures is influenced by the amount and stability of visible pictures.</p>' +
